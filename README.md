# What if 2

*Electric boogaloo*

## What to cover:

### Readings

-   Chapter 19, Time-varying Treatments

-   Chapter 20, Treatment-Confounder Feedback

-   Chapter 21, G-methods for Time-varying treatments

-   Chapter 22, Target Trial Emulation

    -   not necessarily code what they have, but look at Clone-Censor-Weight approach.

-   ~~Chapter 23, Causal mediation~~

-   Chapter 17, Causal Survival Analysis

-   Chapter 14, G-estimation of structural nested models

### Coding topics

-   Software Packaging (R, Python?)
-   Parallelization?
-   First-class functions/arguments
-   Variable-length arguments
-   Generate Data from DAGs (Matt Fox paper?)
-   Obsidian Setups
-   Better at vectorization (`furrr`, `purrr`)
-   `neovim`?

### Other methods

-   Iterative Conditional Expectations
-   Data Fusion?

### Paper ideas?

-   Stochastic treatment regimes

## Schedule

*Unless noted differently, all meetings take place 12pm at Weaver St*
